V2X Research
This repository hosts V2X_NODES_SYNC experiments and simulations focused on secure, high-speed communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and surveillance systems. It explores how Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks can integrate with AI-driven threat intelligence, solar grid monitoring, and secure OS environments.

Overview
The project demonstrates:

Integration with Cyber Sentinel OS v7.0 for secure node synchronization

UNIX_CLOCK diagnostics for time-based coordination

High-speed network traffic monitoring (up to 4.2 GB/s)

Solar grid load balancing with real-time energy metrics

Surveillance grid integration (e.g., restaurant zone monitoring)

Threat intelligence feeds for proactive security

Satellite constellation linking for global node coverage

Features
V2X_NODES_SYNC: Synchronizes 10+ nodes across distributed networks

Secure Diagnostics: AI Sentinel Core initialization and monitoring

Energy Awareness: Tracks solar grid load percentage

Surveillance Integration: Real-time camera zone monitoring

Threat Intelligence: Processes feeds in multiple languages/scripts

Global Positioning: Node GPS tracking for Asia-Pacific and beyond
